## üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Project Contributor
This project was prepared by  [Robert Meza](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robmeza/) as the Capstone Project for the Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Professional Certificate Program at the University of California, Berkeley, March 2025 cohort.

I have been employed by the State of California since May 2009, serving in senior technical and leadership roles. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (2008) and a Master of Business Administration (2014) from California State University, Sacramento. From 2009 to 2016, I held a senior technical position with the California Department of Technology. Since July 2016, I have served primarily as a Senior Information Technology Manager at the California Public Employees‚Äô Retirement System (CalPERS).

The analysis and findings presented in this project are solely my own work and do not represent, reflect, or speak on behalf of CalPERS or any other organization. This project is conducted strictly as an academic exercise for educational purposes. Some of the underlying data used in this analysis may have been modified, reduced, or otherwise transformed for the purposes of research and demonstration.

## üìò Project Overview

### Background
CalPERS is the largest pension fund for public sector employees in the United States, managing net assets of approximately $500 billion. CalPERS administers retirement benefits to over 2 million members and beneficiaries and provides health benefits to 1.5 million members and their dependents.

### Open Enrollment
As part of its annual Open Enrollment period, members may modify their CalPERS health coverage. These modifications include selecting a different health plan, adding or removing dependents, canceling existing coverage, and enrolling in a CalPERS health plan as a new member.

### Objective 
The objective of this Capstone Project is to develop a high-performance predictive model to determine a CalPERS member‚Äôs health plan selection during the Open Enrollment period by leveraging a range of relevant features. Key features under consideration include geographic location, age, number of dependents, etc. Because members are limited to a predefined set of health plans within California, machine learning classification techniques will serve as the initial methodological framework.

### Data Source
CalPERS provided data exports with all personal identifiers removed and properly masked. The analysis draws on data from 2020 through 2024 to identify the optimal range for model performance. These datasets contain between 20 and 25 features and comprise more than four million records. <ins>To address the 25 MB file upload limit, preliminary cleaning and consolidation were performed prior to upload.</ins> The original dataset of approximately 4 million records (2020‚Äì2024) was reduced to 1 million records for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature selection, and a further stratified sample of 400,000 records was used for data modeling

## ‚ÜóÔ∏è Expected Results

The ultimate goal is to develop a model capable of achieving accuracy rates approaching 90 percent while incorporating strategies to mitigate overfitting. This model is intended to accurately predict a member‚Äôs health plan selection with a high degree of reliability, consistent with the outlined methodology.

## üìå Key Findings
- ‚úÖ In the logistic regression model, the initial accuracy prior to feature scaling was 46.6%. After applying scaling, model performance improved significantly, reaching 68.6%. Through subsequent hyperparameter tuning, the model achieved an accuracy of ## (pending)%, reflecting a substantial gain in predictive capability.
- ‚úÖ For decision tree modeling, even without parameter tuning, the model achieved very high accuracy. This outcome suggests that certain features, particularly dependent count and monthly premium amount, are strong predictors of the target classification. In future iterations, I plan to explore removing one of these dominant features to assess whether the model produces a more realistic measure of accuracy.

- ‚úÖ Random Forest ...
- ‚úÖ The dataset is moderately unbalanced.
  
## üéñ Future Work
- Expand the dataset by incorporating an additional 10 years of historical data
- Refine feature selection by removing currently high-performing features in order to evaluate alternative predictors
- Engineer new features that may yield improved model performance
- Address class imbalance by applying techniques to reduce the effects of unbalanced data distributions
- Develop a web application to operationalize and showcase the predictive models
