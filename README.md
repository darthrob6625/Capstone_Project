## Project Contributor
This project was prepared by [Robert Meza](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robmeza/) as the Capstone Project for the Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Professional Certificate Program at the University of California, Berkeley, March 2025 cohort.

I have been employed by the State of California since May 2009, serving in senior technical and leadership roles. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (2008) and a Master of Business Administration (2014) from California State University, Sacramento. From 2009 to 2016, I held a senior technical position with the California Department of Technology. Since July 2016, I have served primarily as a Senior Information Technology Manager at the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS).

## Project Overview

### Background
CalPERS is the largest pension fund for public sector employees in the United States, managing net assets of approximately $506.6 billion. CalPERS administers retirement benefits to 2.3 million members and beneficiaries and provides health benefits to 1.5 million members and their dependents.

### Open Enrollment
As part of its annual Open Enrollment period, members may modify their CalPERS health coverage. These modifications include selecting a different health plan, adding or removing dependents, canceling existing coverage, and enrolling in a CalPERS health plan as a new member.

### Objective 
The objective of this Capstone Project is to develop a high-performance predictive model to determine a CalPERS member’s health plan selection during the Open Enrollment period by leveraging a range of relevant features. Key features under consideration include geographic location, age, number of dependents, and years of service. Because members are limited to a predefined set of health plans within California, machine learning classification techniques will serve as the initial methodological framework.

### Data Source
CalPERS has provided data exports with all personal identifiers removed and appropriately masked. The analysis will utilize data from 2020 through 2024 to identify the optimal range for model performance. These datasets initially comprise 20-25 features and contain more than four million records.
